## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ttizze/eveeve.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd eveeve
   cd web
   bun i
   ```

3. Create and set up the environment variables file:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Run the following command:
   ```
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
   Set the generated string as `SESSION_SECRET` in the `.env` file.

4. Start Docker:
   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```

5. Set up the database:
   ```
   bunx prisma migrate dev
   ```

6. Run the seed:
   ```
   bun run seed
   ```

7. Start the development server:
   ```
   bun run dev
   ```

8. Access EveEve at `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

9. For local development, authentication is simplified:
   - Visit `http://localhost:5173/auth/login` and log in with dev@example.com and devpassword.
   
   Note: This simplified authentication works only in the development environment and is disabled in production. The normal Google authentication flow is used in production.
