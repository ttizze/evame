# Evame

[日本語版はこちら](README.ja.md)

Evame is an open-source project that helps people share knowledge by providing translations, footnotes and explanations for user-submitted texts. Our goal is to open doors to stories and ideas for everyone.

## Repository Structure

```
/
├── next/                         # Main web application
│   ├── src/                      # Source code
│   ├── prisma/                   # Prisma schema and migrations
│   └── public/                   # Static files
└── components/                   # Chrome extension (currently empty)
